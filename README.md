# FractalX

<h3>FractalX demonstrates 3 simple fractals: Sierpinski triangle, snow and tree.</h3>
<h2>The FractalX developed about 2002 in MSVC++ with MFC when I was a studend in high school.</h2>
<p>This application is developed in Visual C++ with MFC libraries about 2002 with very few changes until now except about copyright because I didn't share the source code never before.
The source code of FractalX is still one of the best kind of using OOP(Object Oriented Programming) who have ever seen.
I used polymorphism with MFC dialogs that was magical art of programming.
I developed the FractalX project when I was a student in high school in a weekend.
I wone the 3rd position of Khaarazmy award in Tehran state of Iran by this project when I was a student in school. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarizmi_International_Award">Khwarizmi Award</a> is the most important technical award in Iran.
It's very funny that they ignored my most important project in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarizmi_International_Award">Khwarizmi festival</a> because they couldn't understand it at all and maybe they didn't believe that application was developed by a little student. I had been developed that main project: "3DVector" during one year with C#, VB.net and Delphi. I will upload it later.</p>

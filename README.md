# FractalX

<h3>FractalX developed during 2002 and it shows three simple fractals: Sierpinsky, Snow and Tree.</h3>
<p>This application is developed in Visual C++ with MFC libraries about 2002 with very few changes until now except about copyright because I didn't share the source code never before.
The source code of FractalX is still one of the best kind of using OOP(Object Oriented Programming) who have ever seen.
I used polymorphism with MFC dialogs that was magical art of programming.
I developed the FractalX project when I was a student in a weekend.
I wone the 3rd position of Khaarazmy festival in Tehran state of Iran by this project when I was a little student.
It's very funny that they ignored my most important project in Khaarazmy festival because they couldn't understand it at all and that was the 3DVector project that I developed it during one year with C#, VB.net and Delphi. I will upload it later.
Khaarazmy festival is the most important technical festival in Iran</p>

# FractalX
### FractalX demonstrates 3 simple fractals: the Sierpinski triangle, snow, and a tree.

## Description:
FractalX was developed around 2002 in MSVC++ with MFC when I was a student in high school. This application was developed in Visual C++ with MFC libraries in approximately 2002 and has undergone very few changes since then, except for copyright and the license information because I had never shared the source code before. The source code of FractalX is still one of the best examples of using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in C++. I used polymorphism with MFC dialogs, which was a magical art of programming. I developed the FractalX project during a weekend when I was a high school student. I won the 3rd position in the [Khwarizmi Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarizmi_International_Award) in Tehran, Iran with this project. The [Khwarizmi Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarizmi_International_Award) is the most important technical award in Iran. It's quite amusing that they ignored my most important project that was about visual calculation in 3D space. Perhaps they didn't believe that the application was developed by a young student!

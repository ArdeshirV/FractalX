		<h3>FractalX developed during 2002 and it shows three simple fractals: Sierpinsky, Snow and Tree.</h3>
		<p>This application is developed in Visual C++ with MFC libraries about 2002 with very few changes until now except about copyright because I didn't share the source code never before.
		The source code of FractalX is still one of the best kind of using OOP(Object Oriented Programming) who have ever seen.
		I used polymorphism with MFC dialogs that was magical art of programming.
		I developed the FractalX project when I was a student in a weekend.
		I wone the 3rd position of Khaarazmy award in Tehran state of Iran by this project when I was a student in school.
		It's very funny that they ignored my most important project in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwarizmi_International_Award">Khwarizmi Award</a> because they couldn't understand it at all and maybe they didn't believe that application was developed by me! I had been developed the 3DVector project during one year with C#, VB.net and Delphi. I will upload it later.
